## *Summary:*

Currently I work as a QA tester of software for chemical and pharmaceutical research. My professional knowledge in chemistry allows me to evaluate the correctness of the program operation from the point of view of chemical scientists. In my opinion I have real opportunities for advancement in IT sphere and fast-paced web development seems to me a promising direction to implement my plans.  At this stage, I want to master the necessary skills for front-end and back-end web development of user-friendly products and I realize that the self-education plays a major role in this process.

## Skills:
* basic knowledge of **HTML5** and **CSS**;
* basic knowledge of **Javascript**;
* work with **Git** version control system.

## Code example:
The following code is a solution of small [Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ae62fcf252e66d44d00008e) from CodeWars and returns the largest number obtained after applying the operators + and * and brackets *()* to the three integers *a*, *b* and *c*:    
    
    ```javascript
    let expressionMatter = function(a,b,c) {
        return Math.max(a+b+c, a+b*c, (a+b)*c, a*b*c, a*b+c, a*(b+c));
    }
    ```
