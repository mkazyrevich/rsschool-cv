## *Summary*

Currently I work as a QA tester of software for chemical and pharmaceutical research. My professional knowledge in chemistry allows me to evaluate the correctness of the program operation from the point of view of chemical scientists. In my opinion I have real opportunities for advancement in IT sphere and fast-paced web development seems to me a promising direction to implement my plans.  At this stage, I want to master the necessary skills for front-end and back-end web development of user-friendly products and I realize that the self-education plays a major role in this process.

```javascript
let expressionMatter = function(a,b,c) {
    return Math.max(a+b+c, a+b*c, (a+b)*c, a*b*c, a*b+c, a*(b+c));
}
